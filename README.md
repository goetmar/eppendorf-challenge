# Eppendorf Frontend Engineer Challenge

We at Eppendorf follow a cloud native and FaaS approach on AWS to build the next generation of our SaaS platform for laboratory automation.

## Challenge

Your challenge is to complete two independent tasks:

- Use the data in the provided data.json file to visualize a sortable table/list of entries
- Create a simple registration form with the following requirements
  - Name Input
    - required
    - at least 2 characters
  - Email Input
    - required
    - simple email validation
  - Password Input
    - required
    - at least 8 characters
    - at least one uppercase letter
    - at least one special character
    - at least one number

## Additional Notes

- Use React + TypeScript.
- It's up to you what technologies/libraries/frameworks you use. You should be able to justify your decision though.
- Quality is key! Think of how to ensure the quality of your solution and how to measure it.
- We do not expect a production ready solution here. Focus on providing a clean and reasonable codebase.
- We love Git. So feel free to send us the link to your Git repository on GitHub.

We value your personal life and you probably have a full-time job. Please timebox yourself and don't put too much time and effort into the completion of the challenge (max 6-8h).
